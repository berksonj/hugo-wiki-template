# Hugo Wiki Project Template

This project uses a Dockerized version of Hugo Extended (TODO: add link to docker image and hugo) as a static site generator.

It also uses lunr.js (TODO: add lunr.js link) to implement search functionality on the static site. During the docker build, an index is created using the post title, content, tags, and categories.
